            Output
------------------
The program outputs "Josh Edward". Initially, in pattern1, a function called 'getFirstName'
is added to 'exports', which serves as the default 'module.exports'. Then, 'exports' is reassigned to a new object 
containing a function called 'getLastName'. This reassignment does not correspond to the original 'module.exports';
instead, it points to a new object.

Ultimately, 'module.exports' is defined to contain a function. Since 'module.exports' is what gets exported when 
called by 'require', and it now contains a function, when 'getName()' is invoked after being assigned with 'require',
it simply executes what is defined in the function, which is to print "Josh Edward
